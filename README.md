# Analyse Baseball Data

Master project. team of two. The main topic :
* Formed an optimal baseball team by solving a linear optimisation problem. We decided to maximize the Wins Aboves Replacement (WAR) under budget and team composition constraint (2-3 pitcher, 1-2 catcher etc).
* We created a Shiny web application with R to vizualize hit and pitch data of the team.

the full documentation of the project in Microsoft Word Format can be found here : https://goo.gl/mqqye8

The full documentaiton is in french. However,for the viewer that only speak english, please note that screenshot found in the report will allow you to understand all the project. For more information, please see the code in the repo.

* Graph 5.4.1 show the first tab of Shiny application. We can visualize the trajectory of all hits for one season for each  individual hitter of the optimal team.
* Graph 5.5.1 show the second tab of the application where we can visualize pitch type and trajectory. 
* Table 4.1 Illustrate the linear optimization problem on Excel.

My contribution to this project was to define the project, find all the data set,create the linear optimisation model on Excel and code the Shiny web application.
