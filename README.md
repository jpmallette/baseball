# Analyse Baseball Data

This project was a M.Sc. project of 2 folks. We did essentialy 2 things in this project. 
* We formed an optimal baseball team by solving a Linear optimisation problem that we had to defined.
* We created a Shiny web application to vizualize hit and pitch data of the player identified with the linear optimisation.

the full documentation of the project can be found here : 

The full documentaiton is in french. However,for the viewer that only speak english, please note that screenshot found in the report will allow you to understand all the project. For more information, please see the code.
* Graph 5.4.1 show the first tab of Shiny application. We can visualize the trajectory of all hits for one season for each  individual hitter of the optimal team.
* Graph 5.5.1 show the second tab of the application where we can visualize pitch type and trajectory. 
* Table 4.1 Illustrate the linear optimization problem on Excel.

My contribution to this project was to define the project, find all the data set,create the linear optimisation model on Excel and code the Shiny web application.
